# [PressupBox Development Boilerplate](http://#)

PressupBox Development Boilerplate is a development workflow aimed at distributed teams that use:

* Github
* Wordpress
* Stackato

## Getting started

1.  Install Vagrant v1.1.2 (http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html)
1.  Install VirtualBox v4.2.10 (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 
>  :exclamation: The version numbers are important; and the process of upgrading from vagrant 1.0 to 1.1 is non trivial.
> Follow the installation instructions and then make sure you are running the right version of vagrant 
```
$ vagrant --version
Vagrant version 1.1.2
```

1.  Clone _this_ repo to your Dev machine (tested on OSX Mountain Lion, Windows 7 x64, Ubuntu 12.10)
1.  From the root of your freshly cloned repo, run `vagrant up` to start your development VM 
> * The `vagrant up` config process is idempotent.  If you see any errors, just restart the process by running `vagrant halt && vagrant up`
> * The first time you run this, it will download a 800MB VM image from Amazon S3 in Ireland.  
>      * If you have a slow (<10MB) / unreliable Internet connection you might want to download the VM separately using a download manager.
>      * See the `config.vm.box_url` section of the `Vagrantfile` for the download url.  Append `?torrent` to this to get a BitTorrent download.  You can manually register your downloaded VM using `vagrant box add {config.vm.box} {path/to/downloaded/name.box}
>      * If you're on a fast connection, just grab a :coffee: and let `vagrant up` do all the downloading for you

1.  `vagrant ssh` -> You're now in a sandbox environment on the VM which simulates the Stackato deployment environment.  From inside your vagrant ssh terminal you can:
    1.  `grunt run` -> This will compile your app and launch a dev server that you can access at [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) on your Dev machine
    1.  TODO Any changes you make on your dev machine will be automatically copied to your vagrant VM.  Currenty you must run
`rsync -a --exclude='.git*' --exclude='.vagrant' --exclude='.DS_Store' /vagrant/ /home/vagrant/` from your vagrant ssh terminal after each file change

## Concepts involved

1. [Dev / Prod parity](http://www.12factor.net/dev-prod-parity) -> A local development build & run time is encapsulated in a
Vagrant VM.  Whilst the developer is free to choose their editor tooling; they will be running & debugging their code in an
environment that is nearly identical to the production deployment environment as possible.  
1. Buildpack -> 
1. Build script - the following tasks are automated using the build script:
   1. Compilation - converting source code to running code 
   1. Running - starting 
   1. Deployment
1. Continuous Integration Server - source code events trigger the CI server to run build script tasks; and report on their success or failure
1. Platform as a Service - The hosting platform is a PaaS; enabling scripted deployment
